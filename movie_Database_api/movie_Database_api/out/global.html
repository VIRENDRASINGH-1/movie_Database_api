As a child, he often looked up to his father as his inspiration and role-model. Carl Reiner was on The Dick Van Dyke Show, which he created and also starred in.   When Rob graduated high school, his parents advised him to participate in Summer Theatre. Reiner got a job as an apprentice in the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania. He went to be further educated at UCLA Film School. Reiner felt he still wasn't successful even having a recurring role on one of the biggest shows in the country, All in the Family. Reiner began his directing career with the Oscar-nominated films This Is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, and The Princess Bride,.  With these successful box-office movies in 1987, Reiner founded his own production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, along with Martin Shafer, Andrew Scheinman, Glenn Padnick, and Alan Horn. For Castle Rock Entertainment, he went to direct the Oscar-nominated films When Harry Met Sally, Misery, and A Few Good Men. Reiner often credits former co-star Carroll O'Connor in helping him get into the directing business, and showing Reiner the ropes.  Reiner also is known as a political activist, co-founding the American Foundation For Equal Rights, a group that was an advisory for same-sex-marriage. Reiner has spoken at several rallies on several controversial topics, and is also seen as an advocate on social issues, such as domestic violence and tobacco use."
